## How It Works

### 1. **Navigation & Routing**
- Uses React Router for seamless navigation between Shop, Cart, and Login/Signup pages.
- Responsive Navbar adapts to mobile and desktop, with a hamburger menu for small screens.

### 2. **Product Catalog (Shop Page)**
- Displays a curated list of chocolate products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- Users can add products to the cart directly from the shop page.
- Sections for About, Contact, and more, all accessible without page reloads.

### 3. **Cart Functionality**
- Cart state is managed in the top-level App component and passed down as props.
- Users can update quantities, remove items, and see a live total.
- Cart is accessible from anywhere via the Navbar.
- **Mobile-First Cart Experience:** The cart page header, grid, and sidebar are now fully adaptive. Padding, spacing, and sticky positioning are fixed for all screen sizes. Product images, controls, and text scale and stack for easy use on any device.

### 4. **Checkout via WhatsApp**
- On checkout, the app generates a WhatsApp message with the order summary.
- Clicking checkout opens WhatsApp (web or app) with the order pre-filled, making it easy for customers to place orders and for the business to manage them.

### 5. **Responsive Design**
- All pages and components are fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- The Navbar and Cart adapt their layout and controls for smaller screens.

## Development Process

1. **Planning & Design**
   - Defined user flows: browsing, adding to cart, checking out.
   - Designed UI/UX for clarity, beauty, and conversion.
2. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Broke down UI into reusable components (Navbar, ProductCard, Cart, etc).
   - Used props and state for data flow and interactivity.
3. **State Management**
   - Used React's useState and context (future) for cart and user state.
4. **Styling**
   - Used CSS modules for scoped, maintainable styles.
   - Ensured accessibility and keyboard navigation.
5. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Tested on multiple devices and browsers.
   - Deployed to Vercel for fast, global delivery.
