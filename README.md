# CandyBliss Frontend

## Overview
CandyBliss is a modern, responsive e-commerce frontend for a handcrafted chocolate brand. Built with React, it features a dynamic product catalog, interactive cart, WhatsApp-based checkout, and a beautiful, mobile-friendly design. The project is structured for scalability and maintainability, with clear separation of concerns and reusable components.

## How It Works

### 1. **Navigation & Routing**
- Uses React Router for seamless navigation between Shop, Cart, and Login/Signup pages.
- Responsive Navbar adapts to mobile and desktop, with a hamburger menu for small screens.

### 2. **Product Catalog (Shop Page)**
- Displays a curated list of chocolate products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- Users can add products to the cart directly from the shop page.
- Sections for About, Contact, and more, all accessible without page reloads.

### 3. **Cart Functionality**
- Cart state is managed in the top-level App component and passed down as props.
- Users can update quantities, remove items, and see a live total.
- Cart is accessible from anywhere via the Navbar.

### 4. **Checkout via WhatsApp**
- On checkout, the app generates a WhatsApp message with the order summary.
- Clicking checkout opens WhatsApp (web or app) with the order pre-filled, making it easy for customers to place orders and for the business to manage them.

### 5. **Responsive Design**
- All pages and components are fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- The Navbar and Cart adapt their layout and controls for smaller screens.

## Development Process

1. **Planning & Design**
   - Defined user flows: browsing, adding to cart, checking out.
   - Designed UI/UX for clarity, beauty, and conversion.
2. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Broke down UI into reusable components (Navbar, ProductCard, Cart, etc).
   - Used props and state for data flow and interactivity.
3. **State Management**
   - Used React's useState and context (future) for cart and user state.
4. **Styling**
   - Used CSS modules for scoped, maintainable styles.
   - Ensured accessibility and keyboard navigation.
5. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Tested on multiple devices and browsers.
   - Deployed to Vercel for fast, global delivery.
